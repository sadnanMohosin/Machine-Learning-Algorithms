## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a dependent categorical target variable. In essence, if you have a large set of data that you want to categorize, logistic regression may be able to help. 

## Types of Logistic Regression
* Binary logistic regression: nimal or not an animal—it’s an either/or solution. There are just two possible outcome answers. This concept is typically represented as a 0 or a 1 in coding.
* Multinomial logistic regression: Multinomial logistic regression is a model where there are multiple classes that an item can be classified as. There is a set of three or more predefined classes set up prior to running the model. Examples include:

    * Classifying texts into what language they come from.
    * Predicting whether a student will go to college, trade school or into the workforce.
    * Does your cat prefer wet food, dry food or human food?
* Ordinal logistic regression : Ordinal logistic regression is also a model where there are multiple classes that an item can be classified as; however, in this case an ordering of classes is required. Classes do not need to be proportionate. The distance between each class can vary. Examples include:

    * Ranking restaurants on a scale of 0 to 5 stars.
    * Predicting the podium results of an Olympic event.
    * Assessing a choice of candidates, specifically in places that institute ranked-choice voting.

## Linear Regression vs Logistic Regression
**Linear Regression** is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised regression algorithm. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between the dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.

**Logistic regression** is basically a supervised classification algorithm. In a classification problem, the target variable(or output), y, can take only discrete values for a given set of features(or inputs), X.
